# Quarto Nvim Kickstarter

Companion to <https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim>.

## Setup

Clone this repo into `~/.config/nvim/` or copy-paste just the parts you like.

It also works great for sending code to different terminals
together with `tmux`, here is a configuration for tmux:
<https://github.com/jmbuhr/tmux-kickstarter>

Both of these configurations make use of a "Nerd Font" for icons and symbols.
Download one here: <https://www.nerdfonts.com/> and set it as your terminal font.

Now you are good to go!
